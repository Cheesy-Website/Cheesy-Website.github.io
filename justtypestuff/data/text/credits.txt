-= About CONSTELLATION =-

Constellation was commisioned and created for Now Play This 2017.

Constellation was made for running at parties and events! If you're planning to
show it at a public event, let me know! I might add some words for you!

-= SECRET CONTROLS =-

Things I forgot to mention in the game:

You can hold down SHIFT to hide the cursor and move the camera slower!

-= SPECIAL CREDITS =-

Constellation was pieced together from lots of royalty free and creative commons
assets!

There are a huge number of people to thank for all of this, but I'm particularly
grateful to the following three people:

<b>Emil Persson</b>, aka <b>humus</b>, for his amazing collection of well over
a hundred skybox photos. All of the photograph skyboxes in Constellation come from
his collection.

<b>Chris Matz*, aka </b>amethyst7</b>, for his extremely cool collection of terragen
created skyboxes, 8 of which are used in this game.

<b>Devon O. Wolfgang</b> for his wonderful collection of Starling fragment shaders.
Virtually all the filters in the game are his.

-= SPOILER WARNING =-

A credits list for this game shows every asset there is to discover! Be careful!

-= SOUNDS =-

If you type "music", you'll hear a track called "safehaven" by Stian Stark. http://stianstark.com/
Stian originally created this for another project of mine that unfortunately didn't
work out. I always loved this piece of music though, so I asked him if it'd be ok to
include in the game.
